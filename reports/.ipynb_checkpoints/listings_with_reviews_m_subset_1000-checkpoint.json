It was great walking into a home with units in every room. To think I almost forgot this added bonus\u2026the washing machine and dryer in the unit.

Once I checked in everything was alright until about after an hour or two I began to hear what may have been an animal in the vents. Once this sound began an EXTREME putrid smell began to cover the house as well. So bad that I had to walk out to get fresh air and my friend I booked with was repeatedly vomiting. Although it was hard to sleep with and was very strong we decided to try to stick it out for the night. In the morning the smell was still there so we contacted the owner of the Airbnb and were told they may be able to send somebody, but this never happened and they just ghosted us. Two weeks later I still have yet to receive a response even after trying to obtain a partial refund due to the distress. I had to contact with Airbnb support to receive any help - A decent stay but would not book again"}, {"_id": "6665328ea8d2e0a2fdc5564d", "listing_id": "1000027657512767160", "id": "1040704742959937196", "date": "2023-12-06T00:00:00", "reviewer_id": "428295326", "reviewer_name": "Cassandra", "comments": "Had to sleep elsewhere, all sheets and pillow cases were dirty and stained.

In the words of a great host, Gregorio himself.\r<br/>He is absolutely remarkable. From the first day he was more than willing to help me out with anything.\r<br/>His place is in a cool neighborhood with easy access to midtown manhattan (app. 15 min). Gregorio has a very nice and clean apartment and you get much more than what you pay for :) He is very outgoing and up for anything, like comedy clubs, dance clubs, bars etc.\r<br/>I definitely recommend staying at his place!!

I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and Gregorio is a super friendly, well-traveled man (whom I unfortunately didn't get to interact with too much because he's always SO BUSY! =P). I really enjoyed the neighborhood, actually. It's a predominantly Latino community, which means cheap Dominican/Mexican/Salvadorian delivery and take-out pretty much anyyyyyy time of the day, which I was VERY okay with! Also, cheap groceries in the bodegas on St. Nicholas St! There is also a sprinkling of newer, hipster bars and cafes in the neighborhood. A few blocks east, and you have Yeshiva University, so there are plenty of kosher delis and the BEST SCHWARMA PLACE (Golam Heights)!  \r<br/>\r<br/>Overall, Gregorio's apartment was perfect for my needs. I spent a full month here while doing a visiting clerkship at St. Luke's Roosevelt Hospital....it was an easy, fast commute to work, and there are plenty of cheap food options in the area for those weekend study sessions. :)"}, {"_id": "66653289a8d2e0a2fdb6b490", "listing_id": "100002", "id": "8585810", "date": "2013-11-06T00:00:00", "reviewer_id": "1730057", "reviewer_name": "Rob", "comments": "Gregorio's place was great.

I stayed at his place for the month of April, until my apartment was ready for a May move-in date. The first week was a bit challenging. It seems the drains have been neglected for a while, and neither the bathroom sink or the tubs drained properly. Also, the building is an older building, so certain plumbing fixtures are retrofitted. One issue is the claw bathtub having a retrofitted shower. The main shower head is over seven feet from the base of the tub. There is a hand held shower head that is at a user-friendly height. But the switch lever is on the main shower head, and that cannot be reached by the average person. I'm tall, I stand at 5'9\", and I could not reach the shower head. Gregorio is much taller than me, so it is not an issue for him. The main shower head has no angle. It deluges water in a straight down fashion, which doesn't help much for a female trying to take a proper shower. Especially when the tub is filling with filthy water because it does not drain. My point was well taken by the Airbnb representative, because this is a health code violation. The landlord is exempt because the head held shower held is provided, but if the host refuses to accommodate his guest, then it is a different story. Gregorio said he would leave the hand held shower head activated for me, but failed to do so several times. I was only able to take a shower three times in the first 12 days of staying there. That presented a terrible inconvenience because I was in school six days each week, and we work in an intensive environment and sweat a lot. I had to find alternative places to shower several times, and certain days, I was unable to do so. I was not happy. Gregorio's responses were rather flippant when I texted him to ask how we could rectify the problem. The messages were forwarded to Airbnb, because I needed to show that I made an attempt to have the host fix the problem first. Once Airbnb intervened (almost halfway through the stay), the problem was solved. The remainder of the stay was uneventful. I don't really know Gregorio. My boyfriend and I met him prior to my reservation, and I saw him occasionally in the apartment. He worked during the day, and I had school in the evening, so we would see each other on weekends and when I would return from school, before he went to bed. In fact, there were two trips I made for five days each (one was the Easter weekend). Some we saw each other minimally. Our face to face interactions were always pleasant, but he obviously didn't really feel he needed to accommodate my needs. Other than that, the bathroom is kind of messy with short bits of hair..."}, {"_id": "66653289a8d2e0a2fdb6b496", "listing_id": "100002", "id": "12950316", "date": "2014-05-15T00:00:00", "reviewer_id": "9551554", "reviewer_name": "Nothemba", "comments": "The room is large, airy, bright, clean and very tastefully decorated.<br/>The apartment building and area is very safe. <br/>The location is brilliant. <br/>Gregorio is a most wonderful host.

My boyfriend had an issue with his flight and we could not get in time there, but Gregorio was patient and waited for us with no problem. Also, Gregorio provided us towels and soap to have shower, as well as, coffee to have breakfast. We tried one of his wines and it was one of the best ones we\u2019ve ever tried!

I truly recommend this room for anyone who travels to or within the NYC area especially if you\u2019re coming by car. They have an excellent paid parking facility right next door that costs approximately $20 for 24 hours (versus the $35 rate downtown) which is great to leave your car and use public transportation to tour the city. I will definitely put this room on my favorites list. Thank you Giorgio, you made my stay very comforting despite the circumstances for which I came to NY for.

I\u2019m sure he is used to just getting away with this kinda stuff. He\u2019s a host he is expected to tell the truth as well as supply respectful service, but this was not the case. Please don\u2019t stay here, it\u2019s a scam. AirBNB fully refunded me and helped me find a new place to stay which was very helpful. It did take 3 different customer service people to really help me but it worked out"}]}, {"_id": "66653288a8d2e0a2fdb64f41", "id": "1000734250823805720", "name": "Serviced apartment in New York \u00b7 2 bedrooms \u00b7 2 beds \u00b7 2 baths", "host_id": "88566861", "host_name": "Kasa", "neighbourhood_group": "Manhattan", "neighbourhood": "Lower East Side", "latitude": 40.71908763217981, "longitude": -73.98887785, "room_type": "Entire home/apt", "price": 234, "minimum_nights": 30, "number_of_reviews": 0, "last_review": null, "reviews_per_month": null, "calculated_host_listings_count": 3, "availability_365": 165, "number_of_reviews_ltm": 0, "license": "Exempt", "reviews": []}, {"_id": "66653288a8d2e0a2fdb65302", "id": "1000023148920376325", "name": "Rental unit in New York \u00b7 1 bedroom \u00b7 1 bed \u00b7 1 bath", "host_id": "46410542", "host_name": "Frotas", "neighbourhood_group": "Manhattan", "neighbourhood": "East Village", "latitude": 40.72897, "longitude": -73.98531, "room_type": "Entire home/apt", "price": 110, "minimum_nights": 75, "number_of_reviews": 1, "last_review": "2024-01-28", "reviews_per_month": 1, "calculated_host_listings_count": 3, "availability_365": 132, "number_of_reviews_ltm": 1, "license": "", "reviews": [{"_id": "6665328ea8d2e0a2fdc55649", "listing_id": "1000023148920376325", "id": "1079125367124451589", "date": "2024-01-28T00:00:00", "reviewer_id": "53958663", "reviewer_name": "Bre", "comments": "The apartment and location are amazing - just like the pictures. The place is safe and quiet, but surrounded by everything you could ask for. Super walkable to Bowery, Astor Place, Soho, and beyond. Both the landlord and the doormen are nice and helpful. It was a great place to call home - highly recommended!"}]}]
